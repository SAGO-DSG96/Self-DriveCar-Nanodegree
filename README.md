## First Project - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

### Requisites

- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries from Python (cv2, matplotlib, numpy, moviepy, Ipython)
- Fundamentals computer vision (candy transform, hough lines, set region of interest) 

In this project, I wrote code to identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a short videos stream.
